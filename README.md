Predicting Fruit Prices using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Description

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for regression on fruit data. The main goal of this project is to predict fruit prices based on specific attributes such as weight, size, and type of fruit.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of various types of fruits along with their attributes, including:

- Weight of the fruit
- Size of the fruit
- Type of the fruit

The dataset can be obtained from a data mining course or an internally curated dataset.
